Weather Data API:
Weather Data Analytics API is a backend application built using Spring Boot and MongoDB Atlas that processes historical weather data from a CSV file, stores it in a cloud database, and exposes RESTful APIs for data retrieval and statistical analysis.
The system automatically loads weather data during application startup, persists it into MongoDB, and provides endpoints to filter and analyze weather information by date, month, and year.
